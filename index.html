            Maharaja Ranjit Singh was the founder and maharaja (1801–39) of the Sikh state of the Punjab in the early 19th century. He was born on November 13, 1780, in Budrukhan, or Gujranwala (now in Pakistan), and he passed away on June 27, 1839, in Lahore (now in Pakistan). He was famously called 'Sher-e-Panjab' (Lion of Panjab) and a fierce king who established a reign based on diversity and equality.

             Maharaja Ranjit Singh united various Sikh misls (confederacies) and established a strong centralized state. The Sikh community was not the only group represented in Ranjit Singh's army. Along with Sikhs, the military officers and soldiers also included Europeans, Muslims, and Hindus. His army was made up of Hindu Brahmins as well as individuals from all castes and creeds, and the mix of the government showed a range of religious opinions.
